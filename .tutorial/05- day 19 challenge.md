# ðŸ‘‰ Day 19 Challenge

A common thing people do is borrow money. When people repay money, they pay interest which is paid back annually and added to the original amount the person borrowed. 

You are going to create a loan calculator that shows how much money you owe for a loan of $1,000 with a 5% APR (APR is fancy for Annual Percentage Rate) over 10 years. 

This means each year the amount of money you owe will increase 5%.

Figure out how much you owe altogether for 10 years?

Use a `for` loop and one or two lines of looped code to determine the answer. (Hint: Don't make this overcomplicated. It should only be a few lines of code altogether.)

- Make sure the `for` loop happens 10 times.
- Start your value (amount you are borrowing) before the loop starts.
- If you need to count on one more number, just write `i+` in the `print` statement to tell the computer to add the next number.
