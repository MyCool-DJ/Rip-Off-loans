# Range

The `range` function creates a list of numbers in the range you create. If you only give it one number, it will start at `0` and move to a state where the final number is *one less* than the number in the brackets. In this case, the final number would be `9`.

```python
range(10)
```

Note: The variable is only there during the loop, not after it is completed.


<details> <summary> Fun Fact </summary>

Commonly computer programmers use the variable names `i`, `j`, and `k` when using `for` loops for counter. There is no real reason. It's just how everyone has always done it. However, feel free to use a variable that has a bit more meaning if you like.
