## Invalid Syntax
ðŸ‘‰ This program will add all the numbers from 0 to 99 and continually print out the total. Why is it not working?

```python
total = 0
for number in range 100:
  total += number
  print(total)
```

We forgot the `()` with the range. The brackets are important because `range` is a function (like the exit function). What `range` is doing is creating a list of numbers between 0 and the number we put in the brackets. If there are no `()`, it won't work.

```python
for number in range (100):
```

## Name Error
ðŸ‘‰ In this program, the computer should be printing out day + numbers 1-6. Why is it saying 'day is not defined'?

```python
for days in range(7):
  print("Day", day)
```

The variable name is wrong inside the code. If you want to refer to a created variable in a `for` loop, you have to spell it the same way each time.

```python
  print("Day", days)
```
